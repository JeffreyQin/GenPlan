# GenPlan

Codebase associated with paper * *Planning with Generative Cognitive Maps* *. We propose a novel planning framework that integrates
(1) a Generative Map Module (GMM) that infers generative compositional structure and
(2) a Structure-Based Planner (SBP) that exploits structural redundancies to reduce planning costs. 

## Navigation

Relevant code for the Generative Map Module is found in ```/GMM/```.
