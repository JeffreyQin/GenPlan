    ''' There are two steps to this task. 
In Step 1, you will be given a pattern and asked to identify its constituent fragments. 
The pattern is given by an input matrix, elements of which can take values 1 and 0. 
Your task is to identify a repeating fragment in this input.
Example 1. Given input: [
  [1, 0, 1, 0], 
  [0, 1, 0, 1], 
  [1, 0, 1, 0], 
  [0, 1, 0, 1] ], 
The repeating fragment is : [
   [1, 0], 
   [0, 1]
]

Example 2. Given input: [
  [1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1],
  [1,0,1,1,0,1],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0],
  [1,1,1,1,1,1],
  [1,0,1,1,0,1],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1],
  [0,0,1,0,0,1]] 
The repeating fragment is: [
   [1,1,1],
   [0,0,1], 
   [0,0,1], 
   [1,0,1]]

 To be considered a repeating fragment, the fragment does not have to tile the space exactly, but it should be repeated at least twice.
 The fragment instances may be flipped horizontally or vertically, translated horizontally or vertically, rotated 90 degrees, and may partly overlap. 
 Note that the height and width of the fragment does NOT need to be equal.

In Step 2, you will write a function that attempts to identify all occurrences of the fragment in the input. 
Return a list containing the indexical locations of the top left corner for each copy, along with whether to reflect the copy horizontally and
the number of 90 degree counter-clockwise rotations (these operations together generate the dihedral group D4).

For instance, in the examples above,

Example 1.

def partition():
   return [
      {"top left": (0,0), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      {"top left": (0,2), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      {"top left": (2,0), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      {"top left": (2,2), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
   ]

An alternative, more structured solution is

def partition():
   copies = []
   for tl_i, tl_j in [(0,0),(0,2),(2,0),(2,2)]:
      copies.append(
         {"top left": (tl_i, tl_j), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      )
   return copies

Example 2.

def partition():
   return [
      {"top left": (0,0), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      {"top left": (0,3), "reflect": False, "rotations": 0},
      {"top left": (4,0), "reflect": True, "rotations": 2},
      {"top left": (4,3), "reflect": True, "rotations": 2},
   ]

An alternative, more structured solution is

def partition():
   copies = []
   for tl_i, tl_j in [(0,0),(0,3)]:
      copies.append(
         {"top left": (tl_i, tl_j), "reflect": False, "rotation": 0},
      )
   for tl_i, tl_j in [(4,0),(4,3)]:
      copies.append(
         {"top left": (tl_i, tl_j), "reflect": True, "rotations": 2},
      )
   return corners

Given your fragment and partition, the user will attempt to reconstruct the input using the following function:

def construct_copy(fragment, reflect, rotations):
    if reflect:
        fragment = np.flip(fragment, 1)
    fragment = np.rot90(fragment, rotations)
    return fragment

def regenerate_pattern(fragment, copies, input_dims):
   pattern = -1 * np.ones(shape=input_dims)
   for copy in copies:
      transformed = construct_copy(
         fragment,
         copy["reflect"],
         copy["rotations"],
      )
      height, width = transformed.shape
      tl_i, tl_j = copy["top left"]
      try:
         pattern[tl_i : tl_i+height, tl_j : tl_j+width] = transformed
      except:
         pass
   return pattern

We can test the success of this regeneration with

input_map = np.array(input_map)
output = regenerate_pattern(
    fragment,
    partition(),
    input_map.shape,
)
print(f"Errors and omissions: {(input_map.shape[0]*input_map.shape[1]) - np.sum(input_map == output)}")


Now is your turn. Propose a fragment that can be used to reconstruct the given input.  
Respond by completing the following Python code: 

input_map = ''',
'''

# make sure to define all arrays as numpy arrays
import numpy as np
input_map = np.array(input_map)

fragment = [ ... ]
fragment = np.array(fragment)

def partition():
   copies = []

   # Place your code here. Let's think step by step

   return copies

Please include only code in you response, no text.'''
