Map encoding

Since all room locations are known beforehand, location of rooms and walls need not to be part of state representation in POMCP
We assign an unique integer index to represent each room (note their coordinates don't matter in our case given a well-defined generator)


POMCP definition

- Each state is encoded by (r1, c1, r2, c2)
  (r1, c1) is exit location
  (r2, c2) is agent position

- Actions are encoded by enums
  1 (up/north)
  2 (right/east)
  3 (down/south)
  4 (left/west)

- An observation obtained should entail rooms that become visible as a result of action just taken
  i.e. a set containing the integer indices of all newly visible rooms

- In original POMCP, history is a sequence of actions and subsequent observation
  Our history will entail all rooms that have become visible in the past
  i.e. a set containing integer indices of all visible/known rooms


for observation and history, we need a set-like data structure that supports equality checking (ideally (O(1)) time), such as a string encoding or tuple
